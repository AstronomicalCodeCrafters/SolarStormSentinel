# The SunStorm Sentinel

Develop the Oracle of DSCOVR: The project consists on creating an application that helps us to predict a geomagnetic storm using the planetary K-index (Kp) as a parameter. The idea was to create a model that would take the historical Kp indexes taken from the open data and train a neural network that would allow us to predict geomagnetic storms for a given period of time and at the same time classify them by categories (G1-G5) and provide feedback to the user about each type of storm. It is important since these storms have negative effects on many aspects of daily life such as location systems (GPS), electrical power transmission systems, air transportation (airplanes) and telecommunications. That is the reason why being able to predict when a geomagnetic storm will occur is an important challenge, because if the prediction is very trustworthy then we can send alerts in time and thus take preventive actions so that all human activities are not paralyzed in general.

The project consists on creating an application that helps us to predict a geomagnetic storm using the planetary K-index (Kp) as a parameter.

The project uses Machine Learning capabilities like a random forest algorithms to predict the Kp index to help us to predict when will occur a geomagnetical storm in order to be prepare because this kind of events can have negative impact on Earth. So knowing when will happen we can be able to take actions. We used JavaScript with a framework called Angular v13.0, CSS, for the client code and Python with fast API to retrieve the data that was trained and evaluated into a model.

As hardware we used personal computers with Windows and Mac OS in order to create and run the programs.

### To Run the Project see the README in fronted and server folders.
